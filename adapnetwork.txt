Thanks for sharing the output. Here's a **summary of what's going wrong** and how to fix it:

## ⚠️ Problem: Ethernet Showing "Unidentified Network"

The Ethernet adapter (`Realtek PCIe GbE Family Controller`) has this issue:

* **IP Address**: `169.254.13.36`
* **Subnet Mask**: `255.255.0.0`
* **Default Gateway**: `None (just link-local IPv6 addresses)`
* **DHCP**: Enabled

This means your **Ethernet connection failed to obtain an IP address** from the router/DHCP server and instead assigned itself an **APIPA** address (`169.254.x.x`), which **cannot access the internet or local network** — hence "Unidentified Network".

## ✅ Fix It Step-by-Step

### 🔌 1. **Check Physical Connection**

* Ensure Ethernet cable is properly connected to:

  * Your computer's Ethernet port
  * Your router/switch/modem
* Try a different port or cable if available

---

### 🔄 2. **Disable & Re-enable Ethernet Adapter**

In **Network Connections**:

1. Press `Win + R`, type `ncpa.cpl`, hit Enter
2. Right-click **Ethernet** > **Disable**
3. Wait 5 seconds, then **Enable**

### 💻 3. **Release & Renew IP**

Open **Command Prompt as Administrator**:

```cmd
ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew
```

Then check IP again:

```cmd
ipconfig /all
```

---

### 🔄 4. **Reset Network Settings**

Still not working? Run:

```cmd
netsh winsock reset
netsh int ip reset
ipconfig /flushdns
```

Then **restart your computer**.

### 🧰 5. **Update Ethernet Driver**

1. Open **Device Manager** (`Win + X > Device Manager`)
2. Expand **Network Adapters**
3. Right-click **Realtek PCIe GbE Family Controller** > **Update driver**
4. Choose **Search automatically**

Or try uninstalling the device and reboot — it will reinstall automatically.

### ⚙️ 6. **Set a Static IP (Test Only)**

To test if your Ethernet adapter can communicate manually:

1. Go to `ncpa.cpl`
2. Right-click **Ethernet > Properties**
3. Double-click **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**
4. Select:

   * `Use the following IP address`

     * IP: `192.168.1.100`
     * Subnet: `255.255.255.0`
     * Gateway: `192.168.1.1`
   * DNS: `8.8.8.8`, `8.8.4.4`

🔁 If this gives you internet, the issue is with DHCP — likely from the router.

### 🌐 7. **Check Router/Modem**

If other devices on your network (like your phone or laptop) can use Ethernet or Wi-Fi with no issue, your PC is the problem.

But if **nothing is getting IPs**, **restart your router**.

---

## 🧪 Bonus: Working Wi-Fi Confirms It's Ethernet-Specific

Your Wi-Fi adapter **is working perfectly**:

* IP: `10.84.75.66`
* Gateway: `10.84.75.94`
* DNS is resolving
* Internet is functional

➡️ So the issue is **isolated to the Ethernet interface** — **not a general network or system problem**.

## ✅ Summary

| Problem                   | Status         |
| ------------------------- | -------------- |
| Ethernet IP (169.254.x.x) | ❌ Not valid    |
| DHCP Server Response      | ❌ Not received |
| Wi-Fi Working             | ✅ Yes          |

## Let Me Know

If you'd like, you can:

* Share the results of `ipconfig /all` after trying the above
* Tell me if you’re using **VirtualBox**, which may interfere with networking
* Or let me know if you want help resetting **VirtualBox Host-Only Adapter settings**
