procees od developing the build
------------------------------------
09-09-2025

maven:-
it is the build automation too mainly used forjava project.
it helps the developer to automate the process of compiling the code,
managing the dependencies, running the tests and packaging the software

better integration with ide like eclipse and netbeans

without pom.xml maven project 
html :-
hyper text markup language
it contains predefined tags ex:-<p>,<h>,<body>,<img>
it is used to design web pages & display the content of webpage
usage:-web development ex:-ui,websites

xml:-
extensible markup language
xml contains user defined tags ex:-<data>,<abc>
it is used to store and also organise the data
usage:-it is used for data exchange ex:-configurations

4.Repositories
-maven uses repositories in order to store and retrive the project dependenciesce
-it is having the repositories like local,central and remote repositories
-if any dependencies are not found in your local system then maven will go to central/remote repositories to download.
5. it is having life cycle such as default ,clean and site life cycle
6.it is easy to use(maven will complete the entire processautomatically that is fro compiling to package)
7.it support plugin ecosystem
- it uses pludin to extend the functionalities
ex: unit testing,code analysing and report as well...

some popular plugins:-
---------------------
1.surefire(runs the unit rests)
2.
3.

-
what is pluggin?


8.build automation
-maven automates the build lifecycle which include compiling,testing,packaging
and deploting

9.what is pom.xml ?
>> it is core configuration file in maven project it usally defines the dependencies  build settings and puggins of project consisting all the necessary info about the  maven project 

*)why pom.xml is important
>>maven will download all necessary jar files instead  of you doing in manually
it defines how your project is going to be build and packaged as well it makes the collaboration more easier

NOTE:-whenever we generate the maven project POM.XML file is automatically generated


-maven uses pom.xml file
__________________________


10-09-2025:-
----------

why maven is important
-maven is widely used , powerful and flexible build tool for java project
 -it saves time
it also scales easily
it integrates with modern tool(like jenkin,git)
it ensures consistency

maven repositories
_____________________
-it is like the storage place where maven keeps all the libraries(dependencies),plugins, & project build

there are three repositories in maven

1)local repositories
2)central repositories
3)Remote repositories

1)local repositories:-
this repo available locally when we download the maven from the official website
this repo is denoted as .m2 directory in the local system
once maven downloades the dependency from the central repositories it saves the copy in your local repositories or local system and that saved folder is called as local repo
- the local repository/.m2 it will store all the dependencies,pluggins which are available during the maven of  as well as it keeps the build which got generated 
-by default it stored as in your system

-->c:\users\username\.m2/repository
-->/home/username/.m2/repository

-->next time when we run the project maven will reuse the already downloaded dependencies from the local repository instead of downloading this is how saves time.

-->it stores the pluggins as well as the build output generated by maven 

2.Central repository:-

>>this repository is like an official store(global library) of maven where all the pluggins,dependencies are globally available
this is maintained by maven community(official website).
in this central repository if we require any additional libraries or plugins we can easily download it and it in the project.

* what does central repository  contains 
>>it contains of pre-built dependencies(Junit ,spring.....)

3.Remote Repository:
>>it is the custom repository where we store the build onto the servers.
* in order to store the build in the server we have the tool called as "nexus"
-->if developers

maven life cycle:-
_________________
it is like steps (set of phases)
>>it is the set of phases that maven uses/runs one by one in order to build and manage the project.

there are three main life cycle
-default life cycle
-clean life cycle
-site life cycle

1)default life cycle:-
this life cycle is used mainly for project development and deployment
phases are:-
-validate:it will validate the project information(nameof project, version of project, buildId of project)

command: mvn validate

2.compile:it will check the syntax of the source code
-command : mvn compile

3.Test: it will test the source code by running the unit test it is also called as 
white box testing and it is done by the developers 
unit testing --> testing the code line by line
command: mvn test

4.packaging:-here the source code is converted  into an executable file(.jar,.war,.ear)

command :- mvn package

5.verify :it will verify whether the build that is generated is working properly or not before installing or deploying

command:- mvn verify

6.install :here, it installs the package/build in local system(~/.m2/repository)

command:- mvn install

7.Deploy: In  this phase, we will deploy the final build into remote repository

command:- mvn deploy



11-09-2025
clean life cycle
-----------------
this life cycle will remove the old build files it basically handles project cleaning
command:- mvn clean

why it is important ?
-->it help to prevent the new files and classes from mixing with the old one to avoid the conflict
it will make sure the information of the build (test report ,outputs) are accurate
it helps in keeping the project folder clean


3.site life cycle
>>this life cycle in maven is about the project documentation
it helps in generating the information like 
1.code coverage report 
2.Details of your project(Name, version, Dependencies)
3.unit test reports
4.if any extra configuration is done then those report will be generated as well.

command is :mvn site

why it is important:-
-->it helps the debvelopers to easily share the project with their team members.
Team will be able to get the reports(code coverage,test report,puggin report,dependencies....)
it helps in project transparency

Demonstrating a basic .jar file:-
_______________________________
1.create the folder and open vs code inside that folder
2.open new terminal in vs code.
3.we have generate the maven template by passing the specific command in the terminal.
command : mvn archetype:generate 
	  mvn archetype:generate >archetype.txt 
	(quick start sample project)


decompiler for java

-----------
1. go to instance and lunch the ubuntu instance by choosing the instance type as t2.medium.
2. in network setting allow the port of http as well as ssh
3.create the key pair and use that keypair while lunching the instance
4.connect to the instance 
5.install the java the OpenJDK-17 and maven software in the instance 
command:
___________
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk-y
sudo apt install maven -y 

6.clone the spring petclinic(.jar) from GitHub in the instance
7.get in the clone folder and generate the package
8.expose the port number 8080 in security group of instance
9. in the instance getting the target folder and expose the application through spring boot default port number 8080

command:
___________
java -jar ./<build_name>.jar

10.expose the application and copy the public ip & pest it in the browser through the port 8080

URL : 
	http://<public_ip>:8080

SonarQube:-
____________
>> It is the tool or the open source platform that is used to inspect or analyse the                   
   quality of the code automatically and will tell you how good the quality is .
>> it helps to detect bugs and check the vulnerabilities as well as the security   problem in your
 
why to use SonarQube?
________________________
1.to get bugs early
2.to track code quality.
3.to inspect the security problems
4.to check the maintainance 

Nexus
________
>> it is the remote repository or repository  manager(server) that  is used to store the build artifacts(JAR,WAR...) which is deployed by maven.
	maven         Nexus repository
	(build)____deploy______>(build)	

uses of nexus:- 
_______________
1.with in the company to share artifacts in central place
2.to cache(download) the external dependencies
3.to integrate with CI
4.Security wise and to control access to artifacts

jacoco:(java code coverage)
___________________________
>>tool or plugin in maven project how much code is covered in testing we can get info by jacoco
>> It is the tool or plugin used in maven project to check or measure how much of our code is covered by testing
>> through jacoco we will get to know the report that includes :
- how many lines,methods,branches & classes were executed during the unit testing.
ex: java code of 100 lines we runned unit test let say only 50 line executed once jacoco measure it will tell you 50% of code is tested ,what part how much(manay methods tested how many classes) ,analyses

>> why to use jacoco??(jacoco only for java language)
________________________
1.it will help to check how many lines of code is tested 
2.it will help to check how many branches  / how many classes and methods were tested


Tomcat:-
_________
it is the web server which is used to store the web applications
>>it is developed by apache software foundation
>>it is open source
>>the default port for tomcat is 8080

features of tomcat
_____________________
1.It is very lightweight
2.it is used to run java web application
3.it is open source
4.it can work on Linux, windows or mac
5.it is widely used java server

Drewbacks
__________
1.in involves manual work lot of manual effort
2.human errors
3.it is time consuming
4.slow development cycle
5.less efficient
6. Higher cost


to overcome all these drawbacks we have to go for Jenkins
introduction to Jenkins
heart of devops

what is Jenkins
________________
it is opensource ci/cd that is written by java tool which automates the process of  building testing and deploying the software automatically.
>it helps the devops team as well as the developers to implement the ci/cd process.

why do we go for Jenkins ?
without Jenkins developers have to do the work stating from building to deploying manually which lead to time
consumption and human error
with Jenkins every manual can be automated -- developers after writing the source code can just commit it and remaining work 
will be completely done by Jenkins

>> Jenkins pull the source code ,build ,test and deploy the application.
CI - continuous integrations
________________________________
it will continuously collect the source code from remote repository (GitHub) and generate the build.

CD - continuous Delivery
____________________________
it is the process of generating the build for testing before it gets deployed/installed in production server

Continuous deployment:-
________________________
it is the process of continuously deploying/installing the stable build into the production /client server automatically.

history of Jenkins
___________________
2004 -

2010 -

2011 - Hudson project was renamed as "Jenkins".

----------
a job in Jenkins is basically a task or a project that jenkin s run.
or
a job is a specific task which is performed in Jenkins and through job we can build a code, run tests and deploy the application


types of job in Jenkins
_______________________
1.freestyle job
2.maven job
3.pipeline

1.freestyle job :-
_________________
>> in Jenkins, it is the most basic type of job.
>>it allows you to define simple tast such as building code, running test,& deploying the software
>>it's not required to install any additional tools as it is pre installed.
>>it has point and click setup that means coding is not required.
>>it also provides easy to use GUI.


Features of freestyle job
__________________________
1.easy and simple way to create and configure .
2. it can pull the code from git or any other repositories too
3.it can run build tools(maven,gradle,Ant)
4.it can also execute shell script/bash script 
5.very much suitable for beginner project or small project 

2.Maven Job:-
____________
>> it is job that is specifically designed for project that uses maven 
>>it is designed to build and manage java project using maven that means it automates the process of building ,testing the project (it has pom.xml)
>>instead of manually writing the build steps Jenkins will read the pom.xml file & then run everything automatically

features of maven job
_________________________
1.it is designed for java project 
2.it is good in handling automatic dependency
3.no manuall build steps needed.
4.it understands pom.xml
5.Easier for CI(continuous integ tion)
6.it supports build lifecycle.

PIPELINE
_____________
in Jenkins it is job where you write the steps of the build,tests & deploy the process as a code.
>>we need to write the pipeline script with groovy language.
>> this code is written in the file called as "jenkinsfile" .
>>it is more powerful and flexible then the freestyle job 

FEATURES OF PIPELINE job
_____________________________
1.it is pipeline as a code
2.it supports complex project(workflow)
3.it is reusable 
4.It's version control friendly
5.helps  in error handling as well

Docker (27-10-2025)

system or standalone  application
web based application
client-server application

type of application architect:-
------------------------------
1.monolithic(frontend backend,dtabase  will be implemented in single u nified server)
here all the components such as ui,backend,database s implementad in a single large server
they are built and also deployed together that means it runs as one program
advantages:-
1.initially testing and deployment is very easy as it will run as one program
2.initially deploying is also very simple/easy
Drawbacks:-
1.it is difficult to maintain
2.if there is an issue in any on the component it fails the entire application
3.it is not easy to fix it as it is integrated together.
4.it is difficult to scale as requires redeployment if changes are done in any of the components.


2.microservices:-here an application is divided into small services that are independent.
each and every services will have their own specific function  & runs separately.
ex:-payment page,log in,add to cart,notification
Note-they communicate with each other through apis
Advantages
----------
1.it is easy to scale 
2.it is easy to make changes and as the services are independent it does not effect if any changes are done.
3.easy to update & maintain.

Disadvantages
-------------
1.if it is not handle properly then the communication between the services fails
2.as it is very complex you need tools such as docker and k8's to manage it.

3.3 tier architecture 
------------------------
in this it's divided into 3 layers
1.presentation layer
2.logic layer
3.data layer
---------------------------

 introduction to docker
-------------------------
what is docker:-
>>it is free and open source platform where we will run the application in the form of containers.
>>solemon

history f docker:-
-------------------
>>2010 - the person named soloman hykes, he invented dotcloud it was able to crate containers 
>>2013:-docker was invented as free and open source platform where we can create containers for storing the application .
>>2014:-docker Introduced lunched dockerhub for storing the images for the containers to run aplication

Features f docker
------------------
1.Free and open source  
2.Supports containerization techniques
3.it has dockerhub o store images 
4.easy to use & manage
5.can be integrated with Jenkins too 
6.light weight & fast
7.portable - work same in every system as it has same configuration and 8.scalable - can run multiple containers for balancing/distributing  the load

Architecture of docker:-
------------------------
components in docker 

Alternative tools of docker(5 with only one line info)






docker
________________
docker pull
docker run nginx (to crate containers)
docker build

docker file(to crate your own image) 

Docker architecture components
--------------------------------
1.Docker Client(docker cli
>>t is the tool that is used to interact with docker by providing docker commands
>>it is remote control that gives instruction to docker to perform the task.

ex:-docker run , docker build, docker pull rtc

2.docker host
>>it is the system/machine (virtual or physical) where we can create our own image, pull the images create and manage the containers of own image or prebuild image 
>>it is the main part of docker architecture where docker daemon runs.

2.docker daemon 
>> it is a service running in background that does all the necessary building,running, & managing the containers where application is stored.

4.Docker Registry
>> it is the remote repository that consist of all images(pre build,own,shared)
>>you can pull the images that is required & push your own images as well
ex:-docker hub

5.Images
>>it is the blueprint or template that is used to create the containers.
>>it includes source code of the application,binaries ,dependencies ,library and information of how to run/use the application.

ex:-nginx,postgresql,ubuntu,python,mongodb,httpd etc.

Basic commands of docker:-
---------------------------
1.Docker pull<image name> -->used to pull image from docker hub
2.docker images - used to list all the images that is created or pulled .
3.Docker run<image__name> used to create the container from the image
docker run -it <image name> - used to create the container in interactive mode 
docker run -d <image name> -used to create the container in detached mode
4.docker ps - used to list all running containers 
5.docker ps -a - used to list all the running as well as stopped containers
6.docker start container_name/ontainer_id- used o start the stopped container
7.docker stop <container_name>/<container_id> used to stop the running containers
8.docker rm <container_name>/<container_id>  used to delete the stopped container
9.docker rmi <image_name> - used to delete the image.

SHOT TERM CONTAINER
>>it is the containers will run only for short period of time & itstops automatically as soon as the task is completed
ex:- ubuntu,Debian,python

Long term containers
---------------------
>>These containers will run for long period of time as it is design to run continuously providing the applications/software to run.
>>It will stop only when we manually stop or terminate the container.
ex:-nginx(Web server),database:-MySQL, etc

commands
---------
to stop the  container at once
-->docker stop $(docker ps -a)
-->docker stop containerid1 containerid2 containerid3
2)To delete all the stoped containers at once
-->docker rm containerid1 containerid1 containerid1 containerid1
-->docker rm $(docker ps  -aq)
3)to delete all the images at once 
-->docker  rmi $(docker images)
4)to delete the images forcefully 
-->docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)
5.to create container without pulling image 
-->docker run -d nginx 
6.to give own container name while creating it .
--> docker run --name <own_container_name> <image_name>
7.to delete the running continer forcefully 
-->docker rm -f <container_name>/<container id>
8.to restart the container 
-->docker restart <container Id/Name>
9.To check the log of container
-->docker logs <containerId /Name>
10.To inspect the container 
-->docker inspect <container Id/Name>
